Editorial Note:
Measures 49 and 50 : Bassoons crescendo and forte added.
Measure 51 : Flutes forte added. Oboes have outgoing tie, but next measure has no incoming tie. Keeping tie.
Measure 112 : Violas mf added.
Measure 125 : Voices hold for 5 beats in vocal score but 8 in orchestral score.
Measures 138-139 : Dynamics in flutes and oboes normalized.
Measure 143 : Altos have F# in orchestral score, A in vocal score at end of measure.
Measure 153 and 157 : Only violas have dim. Removing this.
Measure 157 : Violin 2 div. hand written in.
Measure 158 : Trumpet 2 does not have an A in this measure. Inserting.
Measure 174 : Bass clarinet has "to Clarinet 3" instruction but staff label never changes to Cl. 3. Assuming rest of music is for Clarinet.
Measure 181 : Vocal score Altos have E in unison with Sopranos.
Measure 182 : Unmarked percussion instrument in lower staff. Assuming bass drum. Couple of missing dynamics in this area.
Measure 183 : Cellos beat 2 have septuplet. It seems like this should be a sextuplet with the Eb landing on the beat with the other instruments.
Measure 190 etc. : Harp pattern is suspicious, particularly the pattern change after the page turn and the Gs in otherwise a Bb major triad. Recording seems to match score though.
Measure 210-214 : Sul G should include pickup D and Violin 2.
Measure 230 : English Horn has incoming tie. Previous measure has no outgoing tie. Removing tie based on other instruments.
Measure 246 : Trumpet 1 has incoming tie. Previous measure has no outgoing tie. Removing tie based on other instruments and breath considerations.
Cymbal a2 in a couple of places. Assuming this is a redundant indication of clash cymbals.
Measure 299 : English Horn eighth note lengthened to quarter note and accent added.
